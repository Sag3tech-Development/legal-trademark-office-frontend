              We believe legal help should be accessible to anyoneâ€”regardless of
              who they are, who they love, the color of their skin, or their
              economic status.
            </p>

              We strive to support the broader small business community and
              general public through our social impact efforts. To do so,
              we&apos;re building lasting partnerships with nonprofits to help
              lift up underserved and underrepresented communities, often
              excluded by the traditional legal system. Beyond partnerships, we
              take part in corporate giving, and empower our employees with
              community service days off and corporate matching programs.
