            <p>
              In 2001, we established ourselves as a tech company dedicated to
              making legal help accessible to all. With that mission in mind, we
              launched 10 online services, focusing on estate planning, business
              formation, and intellectual property protection.
            </p>

            <p>
              Soon, word began to spread: there&apos;s a new, easier, and less
              expensive way to get legal help.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2010, after a decade of growing our services, we innovated
              again, and created an independent network of attorneys so our
              customers could get personalized legal adviceâ€”without having to
              leave home.
            </p>

            <p>
              With offices in Los Angeles, Austin, and the Bay Area, our united
              workforce of talented, diverse, and inclusive Zoomers is our
              recipe for success, and the reason we&apos;re able to empower
              millions to make their dreams official.
